  <div class="text-block">
    <p>Copyright 2020 OddBird<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>(“Licensor”)</p>
<p>Hippocratic License Version Number:<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2.1.</p>
<p>Purpose. The purpose of this License is for the Licensor named above to permit
the Licensee (as defined below) broad permission, if consistent with Human
Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles (as each is defined below), to use and
work with the Software (as defined below) within the full scope of Licensor’s
copyright and patent rights, if any, in the Software, while ensuring attribution
and protecting the Licensor from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>liability.</p>
<p>Permission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this license
(“License”), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor’s rights under applicable
copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the “Licensee”) obtaining a
copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to do
everything with the Software that would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor’s
copyright in the Software or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the
Licensor can license or becomes able to license, subject to all of the following
terms and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acceptance. This License is automatically offered to every person and entity
subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this License and agrees
to its terms and conditions by taking any action with the Software that,
absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Licensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this
Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also receives the License and
the above copyright notice (and if included by the Licensor, patent, trademark
and attribution notice). Licensee must cause any modified versions of the
Software to carry prominent notices stating that Licensee changed the
Software. For clarity, although Licensee is free to create modifications of
the Software and distribute only the modified portion created by Licensee with
additional or different terms, the portion of the Software not modified must
be distributed pursuant to this License. If anyone notifies Licensee in
writing that Licensee has not complied with this Notice section, Licensee can
keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after
the notice. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee’s License (and all rights
licensed hereunder) shall end<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Human Rights Principles.</p>
<p>(a) Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact
that define recognized principles of international human rights (the “Human
Rights Principles”). Licensee shall use the Software in a manner consistent
with Human Rights<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Principles.</p>
<p>(b) Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a)
regarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a),
termination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles, or
invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law is
consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to Section
2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Hague
Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the “Rules”); provided,
however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such arbitration, in
which event this License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end
immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one unless the Rules
require<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>otherwise.</p>
<p>Unless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All
documents and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and
may be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under Article
43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely manner all
documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated to it,
including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted into the
record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings of hearings
and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal, subject only
to the arbitral tribunal’s powers to take such measures as may be necessary
to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to Articles 18,
33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3) Article 26(6) of the Rules shall not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or entity
for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human Rights
Laws. “Human Rights Laws” means any applicable laws, regulations, or rules
(collectively, “Laws”) that protect human, civil, labor, privacy,
political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or similar
rights; provided, however, that such Laws are consistent and not in
conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute over the consistency or a
conflict between Laws and Human Rights Principles shall be determined by
arbitration as stated above). Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one
jurisdiction are applicable or in conflict with respect to the use of the
Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals
or groups harmed shall<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and any
other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties,
fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee’s use of the
Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the terms and
conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an infringement
of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject to exceptions
under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or infringement, the
terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the
Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject. Licensee also agrees
that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against
Licensee through specific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the
extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this
License, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor may
not terminate this License with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this License is
determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not
affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render
unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction; provided,
however, subject to a court modification pursuant to the immediately following
sentence, if any term or provision of this License pertaining to Human Rights
Laws or Human Rights Principles is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the
Software granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between Licensor
and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision is invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws, the court may
modify this License to affect the original purpose that the Software be used
in compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws as closely as
possible. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its fair
meaning and not strictly for or against any<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE COMES “AS IS,”
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR AND ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY
ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE,
UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>CLAIM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This Hippocratic License is an Ethical Source license
(<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev">https://ethicalsource.dev</a>) and is offered for use by licensors and licensees at
their own risk, on an “AS IS” basis, and with no warranties express or implied,
to the maximum extent permitted by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Laws.</p>
